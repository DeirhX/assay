# Assay — Architecture

A reference for how Assay is built and why. It complements the other docs rather
than repeating them:

- **`README.md`** — what the app is for, how to run and configure it (user-facing).
- **`ORIENTATION.md`** — "what lives where" + the operator workflows (refresh,
  research, trade). *Note: parts of its nav vocabulary predate the current UI
  (see [§9](#9-known-documentation-debt)).*
- **`tools/README.md`** — per-module CLI notes and the Deep Research setup.
- **This file** — the internal design: layers, data flow, the request lifecycle,
  the domain model, and the invariants that keep it honest.

Audience: a future maintainer (human or agent) who needs the mental model before
touching code.

---

## 1. Purpose in one paragraph

Assay is a **single-user, local-first portfolio research and rebalancing
workbench**. Its thesis is in the name: *test every number before you trust it.*
It pulls market data from multiple sources, cross-checks them for internal
consistency, keeps fetched **facts** strictly separate from human **judgement**,
turns a target allocation model into drift-and-rebalance advice, and — only
through one deliberately gated, paper-first surface — can place orders. It is
**not** multi-user, hosted, or a robo-advisor. The research and rebalancing
halves never trade; the opt-in **Trade desk** is the sole order-placing path.

**Non-goals:** no auto-trading, no cloud/multi-tenant, no order generation from
the research side, no live market watching (locked price levels are
human-confirmed limit triggers, never standing orders).

---

## 2. The big picture

Assay runs as **two local processes** (plus one external gateway for trading):

  JOBS --> FLEX

  DATA[("data/ private submodule + data/cache/")]
  DOMAIN <--> DATA
  RESEARCH <--> DATA
```

Design stance, deliberately conservative:

- **Backend is Python standard library only.** `serve.py` is a threaded
  `http.server`; there is no web framework, no ORM, no message queue. The only
  heavy dependency (Playwright) is optional and lazy-imported inside a job thread.
- **State is files, not a database.** Everything is JSON/Markdown under `data/`
  (private submodule) and `data/cache/` (gitignored, regenerable).
- **The frontend is a hand-rolled TypeScript SPA** built by Vite — no UI
  framework. It talks to the API via one `fetch` helper.
- **Facts and judgement are physically separated** and never overwrite each other.

## 3. Repository layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/` | The Python backend: HTTP server, domain logic, research, providers, jobs, IBKR. ~50 modules, stdlib-only. |
| `tools/providers/` | Data-source adapters: `yahoo`, `sec_edgar`, `fmp`, `fred`, `common`. |
| `tools/tests/` | `unittest` suite (offline, ~1s). |
| `tools/hooks/pre-commit` | Blocks committing holdings figures / secrets into the public repo. |
| `web/` | The SPA. `web/src/*.ts` (views + shell + core), `web/index.html`, `web/style.css`, `web/dist/` (build output). |
| `web/tests/` | Vitest unit/DOM tests. |
| `e2e/` | Playwright end-to-end specs (hermetic; `/api/**` mocked). |
| `site/` | A separate static marketing/landing page (not the app). |
| `data/` | **Private git submodule**: holdings, target model, research, segments, journal. Never in the public repo. |
| `README.md`, `ORIENTATION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `tools/README.md` | Docs. |
| `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `mypy.ini`, `package.json` | Toolchain. |
| `.github/workflows/tests.yml` | CI (see [§10](#10-testing--ci)). |

---

## 4. Backend: server, routing, jobs

### 4.1 HTTP server and request lifecycle

`tools/serve.py` runs a `ThreadingHTTPServer` bound to **`127.0.0.1:6060`**
(loopback only; non-loopback hosts are refused). One thread per request.

Routing is four dicts mapping path → handler-method name: `_GET_EXACT`,
`_GET_PREFIX`, `_POST_EXACT`, `_POST_PREFIX`. Resolution is exact-match first,
then longest matching prefix. Everything not under `/api/` is served as a static
file.

```
Client
  → ThreadingHTTPServer (127.0.0.1:6060)
    → do_GET / do_POST
      → route lookup (exact, then longest prefix)
        → _dispatch(handler)  →  getattr(self, name)(...)
          → domain/research/service module
          → _send_json(payload)         (Cache-Control: no-store)
      OR _serve_static(rel)             (web/dist if built, else raw web/)
```

- **Bodies:** `_read_body()` enforces `Content-Length`, a 5 MiB cap, and
  JSON-object parsing; malformed → 400.
- **Errors:** a small vocabulary in `tools/apierror.py` (`HttpError` 500,
  `BadRequest` 400, `Forbidden` 403, `Conflict` 409, `BadGateway` 502). `_dispatch`
  maps these + `ValueError` (400) + `ProviderError` (502) to `{"error": msg}`.
  Truly unexpected exceptions log to `tools/errorlog.py` (`data/error_log.jsonl`)
  and return 500.
- **SPA serving:** prefers `web/dist/index.html` (the Vite build); falls back to
  raw `web/` (only fully works with the Vite dev server). Startup warns if
  `web/dist` is missing.
- **Secrets bootstrap:** `secrets.env` (repo root) and `tools/secrets.env` are
  read into the environment at boot via `setdefault`.

### 4.2 Configuration (`tools/config.py`)

Resolution order for any key: **`os.environ` → `tools/secrets.env` → default**
(`config_value` / `flag_enabled`). Canonical paths (`DATA_DIR`, `RESEARCH_DIR`,
`HOLDINGS_JSON`, `TARGET_MODEL_JSON`, `DEEP_DIR`, `ANALYSIS_DIR`,
`SEGMENT_DEF_DIR`, `SEGMENT_OUT_DIR`, …) all live here. Notable env knobs:
`SEC_USER_AGENT`, `FMP_API_KEY`, the `IBKR_*` trading flags, `ASSAY_AUTO_*`
scheduler flags, `PPLX_*` automation settings, `REBAL_CLAUDE_CLI` /
`REBAL_CURSOR_CLI`.

### 4.3 The job / task system

Long or blocking work (browser automation, LLM calls, IBKR pulls, segment
refreshes) runs as background jobs so the synchronous server stays responsive
and work survives navigation.

- **`tools/jobs.py`** — an in-memory registry (`_JOBS`, lock-guarded, **lost on
  restart**). `spawn(kind, target, …)` runs `target` on a daemon thread; states
  are `queued/running/done/error/cancelled/needs_login`. Cancellation is
  cooperative (workers poll `is_cancelled`). Browser jobs claim a limited number
  of concurrency slots (`PPLX_MAX_CONCURRENT`, default 3).
- **`tools/browser_jobs.py`** — Perplexity Playwright automation (deep research,
  login, URL import). Claims a browser slot; writes artifacts under `DEEP_DIR`.
- **`tools/analysis_jobs.py`** — local LLM CLI work (per-ticker analysis,
  whole-book portfolio review, ticker/report Q&A). No browser slots; portfolio
  review fans out over a thread pool.
- **`tools/holdings_sync.py`** — IBKR sync / history / sectors jobs.
- **`tools/scheduler.py`** — an **opt-in, read-only** freshness daemon
  (`ASSAY_AUTO_REFRESH=1`). It reuses the same button-equivalent jobs on a timer:
  holdings resync (stale > N days), history top-up, stale segment refresh, and a
  market-hours gate-quote sweep. It **never** trades, calls an LLM, runs
  Perplexity, or writes the target model.

**Polling:** the frontend Task Center (`web/src/tasks.ts`) polls `GET /api/jobs`
(fast when active, slow when idle). Inline pipeline status polls
`GET /api/deep-job?id=`. There is no `/api/tasks` endpoint.

---

## 5. The domain: research → plan → orders

This is the heart of the app. The pipeline is a straight line, with two human
approval gates and one gated execution surface.

### 5.1 Facts vs judgement (the core invariant)

- **Providers** (`tools/providers/`) return values as **metric nodes**
  (`{value, source, display?, as_of?}`). There is no base class; the effective
  "registry" is a preferred-source table (`METRIC_SPECS`) inside
  `research_pull.py`. Yahoo is primary/always; SEC EDGAR cross-checks US filers;
  FMP is an optional third opinion (needs `FMP_API_KEY`); FRED is macro-only.
- **`research_pull.pull_ticker`** merges sources into `data/research/<SYM>.json`,
  attaching `cross_checks` (identity `price×shares≈mcap`, Yahoo-vs-SEC shares and
  revenue, price freshness, single-source warnings) with severities
  `ERROR/WARN/INFO`. On an ERROR market-cap identity mismatch it tries to
  reconcile from another source, else **quarantines** the metric (nulled, marked
  unreliable). A pull with no usable data never overwrites a good dossier.
- **Human judgement lives in a separate `thesis` block** on the dossier, written
  only via `POST /api/thesis`. `research_pull` **preserves it verbatim across
  re-pulls** and strips it from archived history. Facts can be refreshed freely
  without ever clobbering reasoning.
- **`verify_claims.py`** is an offline, deterministic consistency check over the
  curated `data/research-claims.json` (identity, claim-vs-mark drift, positivity
  of multiples, a regression guard for known-bogus figures, and snapshot-age
  staleness: WARN > 5 days, ERROR > 30). It never fetches quotes.
- **`hygiene.py`** provides the shared severity ranking (`worst_severity`) and
  `rel_diff` used across all of the above.

### 5.2 Deep Research pipeline

`pplx_deep_research.py` drives a logged-in Perplexity session via Playwright (a
dedicated Chrome profile, headed-off-screen because headless is Cloudflare-walled)
to spend the Pro quota, scrapes the report as Markdown plus Links-tab citations,
and saves them under `data/research/deep/<stem>.*`. `deep_runs.py` indexes those
artifacts and extracts **discovered candidate** tickers from report prose.
`review_deep_research.review` is the **gate**: it cross-references the narrative
against the deterministic dossiers, infers a per-name `report_action`
(heuristic), emits `findings` (BLOCK/WARN/FYI), computes `blocked_symbols` (from
ERROR cross-checks), and drafts a `target-proposal.json`. Its output is always
treated as *claims to verify*, never ground truth.

### 5.3 The target model and the two sizing paths

`data/target-model.json` answers "where do I want to be?" as data. There is **no
formal JSON Schema**; the shape is defined by the validators/writers
(`rebalance.check_model`, `target_model._TARGET_WRITE_KEYS`, tests):

- `targets.<SYM>`: a **band** `{low, high}` (percent of the **invested** book),
  a `rule`, optional `structural` band, `note`, `sleeve`.
- `sleeves.<name>`: an aggregate band shared by `members`, with optional
  `member_caps`.
- `cash_target_pct` / `cash_band_pp` (percent of **NAV** — cash is informational,
  never traded), `funding_order`, `provenance`, `as_of`, `basis_snapshot`.

A **band is a no-trade zone**: only act when the current weight is outside
`[low, high]`. The seven **rules** (`accumulate`, `hold`, `wait`, `trim_only`,
`do_not_add`, `reduce`, `avoid`) encode buy/trim intent; `check_model` enforces
that a rule is consistent with the current weight.

Two independent engines produce the same `changes[]` proposal shape:

1. **`target_construct.construct`** — *per-segment*. Turns a reviewed Deep
   Research segment into sized bands (conviction inference, deterministic
   conviction-proportional sizing within a segment budget).
2. **`optimizer.optimize`** — *whole-book*. `build_pool` unions candidates (held +
   model targets + pins + basket picks), `_derive_conviction` assigns a conviction
   per name by a fixed precedence (explicit basket → pin → portfolio-review →
   model rule → basket tier → held-carry → default), and `size_pool` sizes the
   book under constraints (cash target, per-name cap, concentration ceiling,
   min-position and max-names pruning, conviction curves, sleeve awareness, pin
   clamps).

### 5.4 Working draft (staging) and commit

Nothing writes the live model directly. `tools/target_staging.py` is the sole
path to `target-model.json`:

- Proposals stage into **`data/target-model.staged.json`** via `stage_changes` /
  `stage_proposal`, recording per-key **provenance** (which run/segment/source,
  conviction, pins). Pins guard against silent drops.
- `diff_staged_vs_live()` renders the whole-book diff the Working-draft view shows.
- `commit_staged(confirm=True)` validates with `rebalance.check_model` (blocks on
  ERROR), backs up the live model, promotes the draft, bumps `as_of`, and
  regenerates the holdings summary.
- **`active_model()`** returns the draft if one exists, else live — and the
  planner, what-if, and exit plan all read *this*, so you preview against your
  in-progress plan.

### 5.5 Advice layer (never orders)

Given the active model + holdings, `rebalance.plan` produces per-row drift,
status (`BELOW/IN/ABOVE`), and suggested band-closing deltas in CZK.
`rebalance_overlay` decorates rows with research context (`decision`,
`thesis_lean`, conflict flags) and **price gates** — a locked buy-below/trim-above
level (`price_levels.py`) degrades a buy to "wait" until the price is favorable.
`tax_lots.py` (Czech 3-year-exempt-aware lot selection), `whatif.py` (post-trade
recompute), `exit_plan.py` (tax-timed, liquidity-aware scale-out ladders with an
options overlay), and `risk.py` (correlation / effective-bets / factor-shock
stress) all sit on top. `overview.py` (the "Today" cockpit) aggregates snapshot,
plan, staged basket, journal, and research signals into one prioritized
`next_step` CTA. All of these are **advice**; none place orders.

### 5.6 The guided Plan state machine

`tools/orchestrate.py` owns a durable run manifest and the legal state
transitions; `tools/strategy_service.py` runs each leg on a thread. States:
`draft_running → awaiting_segment_approval → synthesis_running →
awaiting_proposal_approval → staged`, plus `needs_login`, `error`, `done`. The
two `awaiting_*` states are the **human approval gates**. Synthesis spawns a
child `deep_research` job, runs the deterministic pull + review + construct, and
lands a proposal into the working draft for the user to commit.

---

## 6. The Trade desk (the one gated exception)

Two clearly separated IBKR paths:

- **Read-only (always safe):** `ibkr_portfolio.py` pulls a Flex holdings
  snapshot; `ibkr_history.py` reconstructs the full trade + daily-NAV ledger one
  ≤365-day window at a time; `holdings_sync.py` merges pulls into
  `data/current-holdings.json` **shape-preservingly** (a refresh can never widen
  the sanitized shape to reintroduce, e.g., an account id). Raw pulls and the full
  history live in gitignored `data/cache/ibkr/`.
- **Order placement (gated):** `ibkr_trade.py` is a stdlib-`urllib` CPAPI client
  over a local **Client Portal Gateway** (`https://localhost:5000`);
  `trade_service.py` orchestrates preview → place → cancel.

Safety invariants (in `trade_service.py` / `ibkr_trade.py`, tested in
`tools/tests/test_ibkr_trade.py`):

- Refused entirely unless `IBKR_TRADING_ENABLED`.
- **Preview before place:** preview issues a token = `sha256({account, trades})`;
  place must echo it (TTL 600s). A basket mutated after preview is rejected.
- **Orders are re-derived server-side** from the token-bound basket — never
  trusted from the browser. CZK deltas become share counts via holdings marks +
  a live CPAPI snapshot.
- **Locked price levels become `LMT`/`GTC` limits resolved server-side** from the
  lock store — the browser can never inject a limit price.
- **Live (non-paper) placement stays locked** until `IBKR_ALLOW_LIVE` is also
  set; paper accounts are detected by their `DU` prefix.
- Every order needs explicit per-line confirmation.

---

## 7. Frontend SPA (`web/`)

### 7.1 Toolchain

Vite builds `web/src/main.ts` → `web/dist/` (served by `serve.py` in prod). In
dev, `npm run dev` serves on `:5173` with HMR and **proxies `/api` to the Python
server on `:6060`**, so you run both. TypeScript is `strict: false` (staged
tightening) but `noImplicitAny` + `noUnusedLocals` on; ESLint flat config; Vitest
with `happy-dom`; Playwright e2e mock `/api/**` (port overridable via `E2E_PORT`).

### 7.2 Structure

- **`main.ts`** boots: wires global error hooks, `initShell()`, resolves the
  initial nav (redirecting to Setup on first run with empty data), starts the Task
  Center.
- **`core.ts`** is the leaf module: the `api<T>()` fetch helper (routes 5xx/network
  errors to the error sink), DOM utils (`$`, `el`, `esc`), the global `state`
  store, privacy mode, and per-view stale-response guards (`nextToken` /
  `isStaleToken`).
- **`shell.ts`** owns the two-tier navigation and URL state.
- **View modules** (one per view) render into their `#view-*` section and call
  `api()`; shared visualization lives in `band-viz.ts` (before/after band bars)
  and `ladder.ts` (price-level math mirroring `tools/price_levels.py`).

### 7.3 Navigation model

Five workflow-ordered top-level groups, landing on the guided flow:
**Plan → Research → Rebalance → Portfolio → Watchlist** (plus the Settings gear).
`VIEW_GROUP` / `VIEW_SUBTAB` / `GROUP_DEFAULT` map flat views to groups and
sub-tabs; `lastViewByGroup` remembers where you were per group.

| Group | Default view | Sub-tabs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Plan** | `strategy` | — (single guided view) |
| **Research** | `deepdive` | Ticker (`deepdive`), Reports (`analyses`), Segments (`segment`); `pipeline` is a sub-page |
| **Rebalance** | `rebalance` | Rebalance, Optimizer, Working draft, Exit, Trade (+ `target-state` in-group) |
| **Portfolio** | `today` | Today (`overview`), Positions (`holdings`), History, Risk, Journal |
| **Watchlist** | `basket` | — |

The URL is the persistence layer: `?view=`, `?ticker=`, `?segment=`, `?run=`
round-trip through `navFromUrl`/`urlForNav` (bare `/` = Plan). `api-types.ts` is
the hand-written JSON contract shared across views.

### 7.4 Cross-cutting

- **Error center** (`errors.ts`): in-session error panel fed by `api()`, task
  failures, and global handlers; the Setup tab reads the durable server log.
- **Task Center** (`tasks.ts`): polls `/api/jobs`, folds strategy child jobs,
  deep-links finished jobs.
- **Privacy mode**: blurs `[data-sensitive]` values; persisted in `localStorage`.

---

## 8. Data & privacy model

- **Portfolio data is a private `data/` git submodule** — the public repo carries
  no holdings, NAV, or P/L. The code runs (with empty portfolio views) without it.
- **Three sanitization layers** for holdings: raw Flex pull in gitignored
  `data/cache/ibkr/` → shape-locked `data/current-holdings.json` (curated;
  refreshes can't widen it) → API payload further trimmed for the UI.
- **Never commit:** `secrets.env`, API keys, IBKR tokens/query-ids, raw Flex XML,
  `data/cache/`, browser profiles. A **pre-commit hook**
  (`tools/hooks/pre-commit`, enabled via `git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks`)
  blocks accidental commits of holdings figures/secrets.

---

## 9. Known documentation debt

Flagged so future-you doesn't trust a stale line:

- **`ORIENTATION.md`** predates the current nav (it references "Planner"/single
  "Portfolio" grouping) and the `overview`/`exit`/`scheduler`/`target-state`
  views. Its "what lives where" table and workflows are still broadly correct.
- **`tools/README.md` → `generate_site.py`** still describes GEN-marker HTML pages
  and `claim.*` fragments; those static pages were **retired** — `generate_site`
  now only rebuilds `data/current-holdings-summary.md`.
- There is **no formal schema** for `target-model.json`; treat `rebalance.check_model`
  + `target_model._TARGET_WRITE_KEYS` + `tools/tests/test_target_staging.py` as
  the spec.

---

## 10. Testing & CI

CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) has two required jobs; branch protection needs
both green before merge:

- **Python lint + unittest suite:** `ruff check tools` then
  `python -m unittest discover -s tools/tests` (stdlib-only, offline, ~1s).
- **Frontend typecheck + tests + build:** `npm ci && npm run lint && npm run
  typecheck && npm test && npm run build`.

Local equivalents: `py -3 -m pytest tools/tests -q` (or `unittest`), and the four
npm scripts. Playwright e2e (`npm run e2e`, hermetic) is not a required CI gate
but is run before shipping nav/flow changes — set `E2E_PORT` to avoid colliding
with a dev server on `:5173`.

---

## 11. Design invariants (don't break these)

1. **One weight definition** — `portfolio.holdings_weights` / `rebalance.current_weights`; never trust the broker's `percent_of_nav` for options.
2. **One basket definition** — `portfolio.normalize_basket`, shared by what-if and the trade desk.
3. **Draft vs live** — planner/what-if/exit read `target_staging.active_model()`; live is written only by `commit_staged`.
4. **Advice ≠ orders** — `rebalance.plan`, `funding_candidates`, `exit_plan`, `whatif` are advisory until `trade_service` + explicit human confirmation.
5. **Facts ≠ judgement** — providers write numbers + `cross_checks`; humans write `thesis`/locked levels; re-pulls never clobber judgement.
6. **Trading stays gated** — preview-token binding, server-side order re-derivation, `IBKR_TRADING_ENABLED` + `IBKR_ALLOW_LIVE`, paper-first.
7. **Local-only** — loopback binding; no portfolio data in the public repo; the pre-commit hook is the backstop.

---

## 12. Glossary

- **Band** — a `[low, high]` no-trade weight range (percent of invested book).
- **Rule** — buy/trim intent for a name (`accumulate`, `hold`, `wait`, `trim_only`, `do_not_add`, `reduce`, `avoid`).
- **Sleeve** — a group of symbols sharing one aggregate band, with optional per-member caps.
- **Working draft** — the staged target model (`target-model.staged.json`) you review before committing to live.
- **Provenance** — per-key record of where a target change came from (strategy run, optimizer, pipeline, pin, manual).
- **Dossier** — a per-ticker research JSON (`data/research/<SYM>.json`): facts + cross-checks + preserved thesis.
- **Cross-check** — a deterministic consistency test between sources, ranked `ERROR/WARN/INFO`.
- **Price gate** — a locked buy-below/trim-above level that conditions a rebalance suggestion and becomes an order limit.
- **Segment** — a research lens (peer universe); may overlap. Distinct from allocation sleeves.
- **Deep Research run** — a saved Perplexity report + sidecars under `data/research/deep/`.
